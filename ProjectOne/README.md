# Project One: Particle Personality

*The theme of my Project One assignment is "Doesn't leave you alone!"*

About my concept: for the first project of the semester, I was assigned
to create a particle design while using the personality I chose "Doesn't leave you alone!"

It is an interactive project, so the goal is to, or attempt to run away
from the particle or else they will stick to the cursor.
(or with the possible updates = to stick to the cursor). The constant
movement of the cursor attempting to push away the particles somewhat reflects to the theme. 

___

It's features:
- different colors (random hues)
- shapes (circles, triangles, squares)
- interactive (to run away from the particles)
