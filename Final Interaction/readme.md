This is a Pictionary like Project. The intention of the project was to create a party setting drawing game that any user can join. Upon joining, the players and spectators will be selected. The goal of the players is to draw word guesses that are generated for them using a controller (a phone with a gyro sensor). The spectators are the ones trying to guess the correct code.


The game consist of multiple screen as shown below

Depending on the User (player or spectator), there are different types of cases/screens.
For example:
The host consist of 4 screens. This includes the main joining screen, the drawing screen where player one and two would have their drawing displayed, three is the spectator guessing screen and four is the results.
Similarly for the players, we have a join screen where the user inputs their name. They are then brought to a waiting screen and upon game start, they are either sent to the drawing or the guessing screen.

## Installation
This code uses JavaScript Library, P5.JS and p5.sound library.
This code also uses MQTT Paho Eclipse JavaScript

## Run
To run this code, the user will have to open the host code.
As for the players, they will join through the QR code within the host code.

## Future iterations
- Adding Sound
- Converting the controller with gyro sensor to a magic wand like feel.

## Sketches, ideas

This code below consist of the Gyro function setup. Some IOS devices requires permissions for the sensors. The origin of our drawing code comes from the code below.

Keywords/Feedback results
1. Different rounds (speed, time)
2. Party game? (theme)
3. Music, sounds (to be aware of how much time is left?)
4. Strokes/lines (library scribbles/doodles, thicker lines = childish crayon drawing, influenced by 
the speed= fast/thin line or slow/thick line)
5. Background (chalkboard, colour of the strokes)
6. Finish button? (When they're finished) or use the angle of the phone as a stopping point.
7. Goofy prompts, random words in general (if it's a party theme).
8. Rotate between the crowd (anyone with the links is able to draw, so they are all engaging)
9. Instead of 2 players -> more like 2 teams
10. Scoring/Voting = chaos Pictionary, few lines, details,
11. View at the same as the players drawing = keep sending messages for additional points
12. Russian roulette theme type = any player on the team might be picked at some point so they all 
are engaging/participating
13. Scrible library in p5.js
14. How competitive should it be?
15. To think about the screen for each different phases
16. Guessing as we go
17. Different prompts for each team.
18. To think about adding colours based on the lines, speed etc
