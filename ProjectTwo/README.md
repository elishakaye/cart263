# Project Two: Data & Tables

*the data i've chosen is: Top Artists on Youtube*

About my concept: I was inspired by Jer Thorp's projects he created in 2012. He designed
a circular graph with each stroke assigned to a specific theme or topic about the Avenger's
franchise. Some are about each characters debut, an others is about a specific type of character. 

For my project, inspired by this artist, I wanted to create a somewhat circular graph about each
artist and their most/top viewed music, so far up to 2022. When picking a data set, and observing
Thorp's graphs, I kinda imagined it as a sound moving (amplitude) in a way as what music would do.
It was also inspired by my colleagues previous projects, and a lesson we discussed last term.

___

It's features:
- different colors (random hues)
- strokes indicating whose is the most to least (circles, triangles, squares)
- in a circular form/shape
- with a description on the side
- two columns, and over 1000 rows of artists
